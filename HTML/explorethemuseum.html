                                 museum comes from a stamp that doesn't exist, which is actually quite funny. You see, the Blue Penny stamp is actually a two pence stamp, while the Red Penny stamp is the one penny. So, in essence, we work in a museum named after a stamp that doesn't exist! It’s a quirky little detail that adds to the charm of the Blue Penny Museum."</p>

Lined with high royal palm trees, it leads straight to the Government House, a beautiful French colonial structure dating back to i think 1738-1738. I remember the first time I saw the solemn statue of Queen Victoria standing outside, it struck me with its beauty. However the one that really captures the essence of Port Louis is the dynamic statue of Governor Colonel Mahé de Labourdonnais at the end of the avenue. It has become a symbol of our city and our island which i always tell my grandchildren about.</p>

                        <p>The Line Barracks in Port Louis, Mauritius, have a rich and significant history. Established in 1740 during the French colonial period, the Line Barracks were originally built to house French soldiers. This military complex has played a crucial role in the island’s defense and administration throughout its history.

                            During the British colonial period, which began in 1810, the barracks continued to serve as a military installation. The British expanded and fortified the site, and it became the headquarters for the British garrison in Mauritius. The complex included various buildings, such as officers’ quarters, stables, and storage facilities.</p>

                        <p>"One interesting fact of Citadel is that, despite its formidable construction, it never saw military action. Instead, it has served various purposes over the years. During the British colonial period, it was used as a prison. Today, the fort has become a popular tourist attraction and a venue for cultural events, such as music festivals and art exhibitions. Its historical significance and panoramic views of Port Louis make it a favorite spot for both locals and visitors.</p>

                        <p>In the 1960s, when I was 10 years old, I remember the vibrant parties and weddings that took place in the Chinese quarter of Port Louis. The area has retained its authentic character with its enchanting, centuries-old shops. Also we have shops offering a variety of dishes, including mine bouille, porc, and dumplings, among others. Reflecting on those times now, I feel nostalgic and miss those memorable moments dearly.</p>

                        <p>The main shrine of the 'Kailasson' temple features intricate sculptures depicting various forms of Shiva and mythological stories. The artwork at the Sockalingam Meenakshi Amman temple is unique in Mauritius, inspired by the style of the Meenakshi temple in Madurai, India. It showcases Tamilian influences with expressive details and graceful poses. This craftsmanship is a rare gem in Mauritian culture, setting Kailasson apart from newer temples where such quality is harder to find.
