                For primary schools, the Port Louis Open-Air Museum offers a variety of engaging and educational activities designed to spark curiosity and foster a love for history and culture. Our programs include interactive guided tours that are specially tailored to introduce young learners to the rich history and vibrant culture of Mauritius.

They also experience historical reenactments, witnessing significant events and daily life in old Port Louis firsthand, which provides them with insights into how people lived, worked, and played in the past. Additionally, storytelling sessions delve into Mauritius's history, exploring key events, cultural milestones, and significant figures that have shaped the island's identity.
